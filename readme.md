### 3.4 About Me

This page is about introducing the client to the customer

People often feel nervous about signing up with a Personal Trainer, so it is important to show that the client is a friendly and likable person who really wants to help the customer with their personal journey

It should include positive imagery that has an uplifting feel

## 4.0 Features

### 4.1 Colour Scheme and Font

The selected colour scheme for the site was as follows with purple the dominant colour.  Pink icons and borders would be used with white used mainly for text and backgrounds. We will add some animation to navigation links in order to add a little visual interest to the site

Purple: rgb(70, 22, 154)
Pink: rgb(255, 192, 203)
White: rgb(255, 255, 255)

Transparancy will be used where appropriate to add any required variatiosn to the colour scheme

After a review of Google Fonts 'Poppins' was selected as the primary font with Amatic SC used for quote style text

### 4.2 Navigation

The navigation function must exist on all pages and be fully responsive

This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button

It will be identical on each page and will be shown as a 'hamburger' menu

![Nav1](docs/features/nav1.png)

When expanded it shows simple navigation option, is underlined to show the active page and is animated on hover so the user knows which page will be selected

![Nav](docs/features/nav.png)

Other links are shown that are usually white but change to pink on hover.  These are used to provide quick navigation at convienient places on the site

![Nav2](docs/features/nav2.png)

Buttons will also be used that change color on hover, again these are used to give quick navigation options and to direct the flow of the site

![Nav3](docs/features/nav3.png)

### 4.3 Hero Image

This has a very simple header above the hero image as we already use the company logo in the header and we want the strong images of fit people training and exercises to be highly insprirational

![Hero](docs/features/hero.png)

### 4.4 Homepage Mid Section

This shows headline information about key areas of the clients expertise and pictures that motivate you to strive to be like the people in the image or to find out more

![Homepage mid](docs/features/homepage-mid.png)

### 4.5 Testimonials

Shown using the Amatic SC font so it is eyecatching, looks more like "speech" and adds visual variety to the page the testimonial can be see in this image about the accreditation section

The testimonials give reassurance from users that the client is knowledgable and capable

![Testimonial](docs/features/testimonial-accreditation.png)

### 4.6 Accreditations

A visual representation of the clients credentials this section is outlined in pink to highlight it and give reassurance that the client has undergone extensive training

![Accreditation](docs/features/testimonial-accreditation.png)

### 4.7 Information on Types of Session

Buttons provide the oppourtunity for the user to book a session via the booking form

![Sessions](docs/features/sessions.png)

### 4.8 Pricing

Pricing is shown on each session view as per the screenshot above

Below the session descriptions is a text description of the types of session

![Pricing](docs/features/pricing.png)

### 4.9 Booking Form

The booking form captures the information required to begin the process of booking sessions

A date selector is included so the user can pick the preferred day for the session

![Book](docs/features/book.png)

### 4.10 About Me Section

It is importnnt to show the client as a friendly and qualifed personal trainer and this is what the about me page does

It is difficult to give the level of information required without it becoming quite "wordy" so the page is split up with interesting images

![About Me](docs/features/about.png)

### 4.11 Contact Me Section

The contact me form uses a similar layout to the booking page but also asks the user what their main goals are and has email and phone contact details

![Contact](docs/features/contact.png)

### 4.12 Map

The google maps iframe is shown on the contact me page so that the user knows where sessions are to be held

![Map](docs/features/map.png)

### 4.13 Logo

The company logo is white on a transparent background and is included at the top of each page

The white contrasts well with the purple header

![Logo](docs/features/logo.png)

### 4.14 Footer

The footer displays links to the clients three social media accounts

Each logo will change color and animate on hove so the user knows they are highlighting it
