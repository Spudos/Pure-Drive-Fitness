# Pure Drive Fitness

A client of mine, has just finished training as a Personal Trainer

Pure Drive Fitness aims to provide friendly, informed and tailored training for people who have specific targets in mind or want to feel better about their physical fitness.  The site needs to provide confidence that the client is a well-educated, friendly and professional and able to help with different areas of training.

The target audience is primarily young to middle-aged female clients.  A simple, easy to use website would be the client’s preference.

She would like a website that has the following features:

1. Fully responsive

2. Has a logical flow that leads to a contact me page

3. Has pages for the types of help she can give, information about her, pricing options and some of her favourite exercises and foods

4. She has requested a colour scheme that incorporates the shade of purple that is her key corporate style plus other colours that soften the imagery and give it a more feminine feel

5. A footer that shows her social media information

6. Simple and easy to use navigation

## Features

### Colour Scheme and Font

The selected colour scheme for the site was as follows with purple the dominant colour.  Pink icons and borders would be used with white used mainly for text and backgrounds. We will add some animation to navigation links in order to add a little visual interest to the site

Purple: rgb(70, 22, 154)
Pink: rgb(255, 192, 203)
White: rgb(255, 255, 255)

Transparancy will be used where appropriate to add any required variatiosn to the colour scheme

After a review of Google Fonts 'Poppins' was selected as the primary font

### Navigation

The nav function must exist on all pages and be fully responsive

It will be identical on each page and will be shown as a 'hamburger' menu for smaller screens and as a horizontal list for larger screens

This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button

Additional nav elements will be included to 'jump' to specific areas of interest

There will also be links that allow a flow through the website.

### Website flow

The client and I had a website flow concept that would result in the customer using the sign up function

It is important that the customer gains confidence in the client and feels that they are both knowledgeable and approachable

Therefore, we included sections that cover each of these areas

Help page - knowledgeable, how I can help
About me - friendly, you can approach me
Book Sessions and pricing

### Landing page image and style

The landing page will include a hero image of someone completing a race or challenge promoting the idea that you too can succeed in your goals

The body will include some simple links and icons to direct you to other areas of the site that you may be interested in

### How I Help page

This page highlights specific areas of training and how the client can help with it

The page should give the impression of the client having the required skills to achieve these goals

Imagery should focus on being aspirational showing customers how they can end up looking if they sign up with the client

### Booking and pricing

This page will show the various types of session and the price for each session

This will also give information on how to book sessions

### About me page

This page is about introducing the client to the customer

People often feel nervous about signing up with a Personal Trainer, so it is important to show that the client is a friendly and likable person who really wants to help the customer with their personal journey

### Contact page

We will include a simple sign-up form that does not require too much information so that there are few barriers to the sign up

We want to gather just enough information for the client to be able to contact the customer and begin the process of arranging session

We will include location information in the form of google maps and an address

### Footer

The footer will include links to social media (Instagram, Facebook, X) as the client will update customers on events via these mediums
